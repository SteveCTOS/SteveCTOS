      *So far the variables which will be specified from inside the
      *   COBOL programs are:
      *$1 = The username                         e.g. steve
      *$2 = The company number from 01 to 12     e.g. 07
      *$3 = The Printername to print the file to e.g. MP250
      *$4 = The Print file name which will replace
      *                /ctools/spl/CrPrintCo01 when specified in COBOL


      * add any extra commands here - perhaps cups printing
      * or sendfax via hylaFAX
